# Kusto Exploration Instructions

When performing Kusto queries, telemetry analysis, or data exploration tasks for VS Code, consult the comprehensive Kusto instructions located at:

**[kusto-vscode-instructions.md](../../../vscode-internalbacklog/instructions/kusto/kusto-vscode-instructions.md)**

These instructions contain valuable information about:
- Available Kusto clusters and databases for VS Code telemetry
- Common query patterns and best practices
- Schema information and table structures
- Tips for effective data exploration

Reading these instructions before writing Kusto queries will help you write more accurate and efficient queries, avoid common pitfalls, and leverage existing knowledge about VS Code's telemetry infrastructure.

(Make sure to have the main branch of vscode-internalbacklog up to date in case there are problems).
